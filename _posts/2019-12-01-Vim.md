I waited so long to write about technology! This is my first technology post and it's about the best text editor in the world: `Vim`.

### My General Experience with Vim
I started to use Vim when I took the course *Computer Architecture and Systems Programming* in my junior year, because the only other option for an editor in terminal is Nano, which I hated a lot. I didn't seriously wrote my `.bashrc`, `.vimrc`, and `tmux.conf` till the summer followed. However, I didn't improve my Vim skills afterwards, since there weren't many scenarios to force me to, and I was pretty happy with VSCode and Sublime Text.

When I worked at GS, I used `less` more than `Vim`. There were few times requiring my Vim skills to edit files on a server, but far from getting more familiar with it. Though I was busy with work, I always wanted to refresh my skills on Vim when I get time.

Now is the time.

### Vim or NeoVim?
TBH, essentially both behave mostly the same, but NeoVim gives me a better time. So I will write about NeoVim in the following article. ???

Fun fact: Vim stems from Vi and stands for `Vi IMproved`. The prefix "Neo" in "NeoVim" is pretty self-evident that NeoVim stems from Vim. But why isn't NeoVim called "Vimim"? How do you pronounce this word? ðŸ˜¬

Note: for NeoVim, you don't type `neovim` to start it, but `nvim`. Pretty cool, huh?

### How to download and install NeoVim
For my Mac, I use `brew install nvim` to install NeoVim and `brew upgrade nvim` to upgrade it.

### Modes
Most users are surprised that there are so many modes in Vim: normal, insert, visual, ???

Why does Vim need so many modes while in most other editors you just click with your cursor at the desired spot and start editing? Initially it's designed for use both from a command-line interface and as a standalone application in a GUI. Without a mouse/cursor, the user needs the *normal* mode to navigate around the file.

When we edit a file, we read and choose where to edit more often than we type, so we need faster ways to navigate, which what Vim is good at and why it is still used today after almost 3 decades since its initial release in 1991.

### Commands
When you enter Vim, the default mode is *normal*. To start typing, you need to enter the *insert* mode, and here is how:

| Command | Usage | Comment | 
|:---:|:----|:----|
| a   | *a*ppend   | after the current character   | 
| i   | *i*nsert   | before the current character   | 
| o   | *o*pen a new line **below**   |    | 

| Command | Usage | Comment | 
|:---:|:----:|:----|
| A | *a*ppend at end of line |    | 
| I | *i*nsert at start of line |    | 
| O | *o*pen a new line **above** | opposite from `o` | 


To go back to *normal* mode, you just press `esc`.
