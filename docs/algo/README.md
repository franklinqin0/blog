This site is composed of notes for algorithm problems I solved, mainly on [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com).

## Why I Am Doing This

While most people do Leetcode to find a (better) job, I do it for multiple reasons: review my algorithm knowledge, improve coding skills, and ofc find an SDE job.

Other than these reasons, I also learned `C++` along the way because there are many solutions on Leetcode discussions written in the language.

## Languages

Now I use Python3.

### Java

I previously used `Java` extensively, because one of my best friends said Java gives you a better time to explain the underlying data structure.

### C++

I was actually learning the language and am now reading many solutions in this language. However, C++ is known for a steep learning curve, and I don't think it's a good idea to write my solution while checking how to do a thing in it.

### Python 3

My officially first programming language is Python 2, from which I learned if, for, while, simple but useful data structures like list and map, and finally even a little OOP before learning Java. Several years later, Python is extinct and Python 3 inherits the speed, simplicity and elegance.

Thus, now I am using Python 3 to solve algo problems and learning through [EPI in Python](https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Programming-Interviews-Python-Insiders/dp/1537713949).

## Blog Structure

Following is the structure for each blog:

- picture or link of problem
- code snippet if any
- solution
  - state the brute force solution
  - elaboration of algo
  - time&space complexities
  - code
- follow up or note if any

## Coda

This is [about this site](/blog/about_algo) if you are interested.

This is [glossary](/blog/glossary) if you don't get some abbreviations.
