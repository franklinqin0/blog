At GS, people like to use abbreviations w/i the company and teams. There is even a website to keep track of the mappings from abbrevations to full names and meanings. I think it's a good idea if definition is clear and doesn't cause confusion. Thus, I build the glossary below in case you don't understand some abbreviation I mentioned.

## General Abbreviations

| Abbreviations | Full Name | 中文意思
