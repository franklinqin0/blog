::: tip 春夜宴从弟桃花园序
夫天地者，万物之逆旅；光阴者，百代之过客。而浮生若梦，为欢几何？古人秉烛夜游，良有以也。况阳春召我以烟景，大块假我以文章。会桃李之芳园，序天伦之乐事。群季俊秀，皆为惠连；吾人咏歌，独惭康乐。幽赏未已，高谈转清。开琼筵以坐花，飞羽觞而醉月。不有佳作，何伸雅怀？如诗不成，罚依金谷酒数。

::: tip 临江仙·柳絮
白玉堂前春解舞，东风卷得均匀。蜂围蝶阵乱纷纷。几曾随逝水？岂必委芳尘？  
万缕千丝终不改，任他随聚随分。韶华休笑本无根。好风凭借力，送我上青云。

::: tip 洞仙歌·丁卯八月病中作
贤愚相去，算其间能几。差以毫厘缪千里。细思量义利，舜跖之分，孳孳者，等是鸡鸣而起。  
味甘终易坏，岁晚还知，君子之交淡如水。一饷聚飞蚊，其响如雷，深自觉、昨非今是。羡安乐窝中泰和汤，更剧饮，无过半醺而已。

::: tip 木兰花·拟古决绝词柬友
人生若只如初见，何事秋风悲画扇。
等闲变却故人心，却道故人心易变。
骊山语罢清宵半，泪雨霖铃终不怨。
何如薄幸锦衣郎，比翼连枝当日愿。

::: tip If
If you can keep your head when all about you  
 Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,  
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,  
 But make allowance for their doubting too;  
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,  
 Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies,  
Or being hated, don’t give way to hating,  
 And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;  
 If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;  
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster  
 And treat those two impostors just the same;  
If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken  
 Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,  
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,  
 And stoop and build ’em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings  
 And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,  
And lose, and start again at your beginnings  
 And never breathe a word about your loss;  
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew  
 To serve your turn long after they are gone,  
And so hold on when there is nothing in you  
 Except the Will which says to them: ‘Hold on!’

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,  
 Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,  
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,  
 If all men count with you, but none too much;  
If you can fill the unforgiving minute  
 With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run,  
Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,  
 And—which is more—you’ll be a Man, my son!

::: tip The invitation
It doesn't interest me  
what you do for a living.  
I want to know  
what you ache for  
and if you dare to dream  
of meeting your heart's longing.

It doesn't interest me  
how old you are.  
I want to know  
if you will risk  
looking like a fool  
for love  
for your dream  
for the adventure of being alive.

It doesnt interest me  
what planets are  
squaring your moon...  
I want to know  
if you have touched  
the centre of your own sorrow  
if you have been opened  
by life's betrayals  
or have become shrivelled and closed  
from fear of further pain.

I want to know  
if you can sit with pain  
mine or your own  
without moving to hide it  
or fade it  
or fix it.

I want to know  
if you can be with joy  
mine or your own  
if you can dance with wildness  
and let the ecstasy fill you  
to the tips of your fingers and toes  
without cautioning us  
to be careful  
to be realistic  
to remember the limitations  
of being human.

It doesn't interest me  
if the story you are telling me  
is true.  
I want to know if you can  
disappoint another  
to be true to yourself.  
If you can bear  
the accusation of betrayal  
and not betray your own soul.  
If you can be faithless  
and therefore trustworthy.

I want to know if you can see Beauty  
even when it is not pretty  
every day.  
And if you can source your own life  
from its presence.

I want to know  
if you can live with failure  
yours and mine  
and still stand at the edge of the lake  
and shout to the silver of the full moon,  
"Yes."

It doesn't interest me  
to know where you live  
or how much money you have.  
I want to know if you can get up  
after the night of grief and despair  
weary and bruised to the bone  
and do what needs to be done  
to feed the children.

It doesn't interest me  
who you know  
or how you came to be here.  
I want to know if you will stand  
in the centre of the fire  
with me  
and not shrink back.

It doesn't interest me  
where or what or with whom  
you have studied.  
I want to know  
what sustains you  
from the inside  
when all else falls away.

I want to know  
if you can be alone  
with yourself  
and if you truly like  
the company you keep  
in the empty moments.

::: tip Seven times I have despised my soul
The first time when I saw her being meek that she might attain height.  
The second time when I saw her limping before the crippled.  
The third time when she was given to choose between the hard and the easy, and she chose the easy.  
The fourth time when she committed a wrong, and comforted herself that others also commit wrong.  
The fifth time when she forbode for weakness, and attributed her patience to strength.  
The sixth time when she despised the ugliness of a face, and knew not that it was one of her own masks.  
And the seventh time when she sang a song of praise, and deemed it a virtue.
