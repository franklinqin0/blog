## 2014 年 8 月 16 日

由 HK 坐飞机去美国念书。晚上的飞机，白天无事，便凭着一股热情和少年无知一人在手机无网的情况下在 HK 乱逛。好在 MTR 的工作人员和 HK 的路人都十分热情礼貌，告知我路线。去了李小龙的住址（当时成为一家酒店）和黄家驹的墓。也许因不常去 HK，机会难得，当天的情景都历历在目，仿佛发生在昨日。在家驹的墓前，有一本石书，左右分别写：

- 生命不在乎得到什么，只在乎做过什么
- 摇滚精神，永垂不朽

也许因失恋的缘故，变成了一位伤感却写不出诗、只会微醺后唱歌的文艺青年。既要读诗，便读好久以来都想读的泰戈尔(Tagore)。可惜只看了飞鸟集(Stray Birds)，便不想看其他的了。记录了以下十分喜欢的对话：

- What you are you do not see, what you see is your shadow
- The bird wishes it were a cloud. The cloud wishes it were a bird
- The waterfall sings, "I find my song, when I find my freedom"
- You smiled and talked to me of nothing and I felt that for this I had been waiting long
- Life is given to us, we earn it by giving it
- Chastity is a wealth that comes from abundance of love
- Let life be beautiful like **summer flowers** and death like **autumn leaves** (生如夏花之绚烂，死如秋叶之静美)
- The grass seeks her crowd in the earth. The tree seeks his solitude of the sky

随性看，两三个星期后，终于读完了《京华烟云》，很精彩。LYT 还是读了许多书的人，对儒释道都有研究，以木兰为主角，讲了中国 1900-1938 年的大事件与姚曾两家人物的际遇。虽有些瑕疵，但瑕不掩瑜，我从中也学到了许多中国 20 世纪前 40 年的近代历史、为人处事之道、和一些新奇的知识。我十分挑剔，佳句不断，但只记录了以下几句不错的话：

- 正直自持，则外邪不能侵
- 在人生各方面，人会由常人之俗进入雅人之俗。只有少数人能脱离雅人之俗，而回到俗人之淳朴自然。
- 再大的灾难，人的精神都能克服，能超越，由于精神的坚强弘毅，能将之改变而成为伟大荣耀，光辉万丈。
- 他常常会沉默一会儿，可是一说到自己所知，或自己所深信的事，则言辞犀利，足以表示他对其精通有研究，使听者在此专题上，不做第二人想。有一次，他对木兰说：“**对一事一物若有真知，若有真了解，乃一大乐事。**”

最近又道听途说了以下的话，对未来的打算似乎清楚了些：

- 最大的自由，是在**认为正确的事上一直做下去**，这是至高的追求，比实现财务自由难得多
- 术业有专攻，隔行如隔山，换一个行业都要从零开始，换来换去一辈子很快就会过去
  - 所以，干一行就要爱一行，要对这行感兴趣。但是感兴趣**不代表只有快乐，没有痛苦**
  - 如果你可以**执着于自己认定的专业几十年，不断从痛苦中获得快乐，获得成就感，那才是真正的感兴趣。从一而终，也会使你的人生获得巨大成功**
- 所谓**追求的极致**，从不是蜻蜓点水、浅尝辄止，而是**锲而不舍**，终有一天，你的手中也能开出花
- 在每一个阶段喜欢做不同的事情，产业也好，技术也好，发展有大的趋势，但从个人角度更多的是要**找到自己喜欢做的事**
- 我觉得有一技之长，过平凡而伟大的人生，足也。努力过，拼搏过，无怨无悔。
- 你知道应该在什么场合承认**自己的渺小**？在**智慧**面前，在**美**面前，在**大自然**面前，但**不是在人群面前**。在人群中，应该意识到**自己的尊严**
- 叶卡捷琳娜二世：我时常告诉自己，幸福或是悲痛都取决于内心。如果遇见不幸，那就鼓起勇气去超越。即便眼前都是惨淡，人也可以快乐勇敢

At the heart of science is an essential balance between two seemingly contradictory attitudes--an openness to new ideas, no matter how bizarre or counterintuitive they may be, and the most ruthless skeptical scrutiny of all ideas, old and new. This is how deep truths are winnowed from deep nonsense.

I think that it’s extraordinarily important that we in computer science keep fun in computing. When it started out, it was an awful lot of fun…I hope the field of computer science never loses its sense of fun…What’s in your hands, I think and hope, is intelligence: the ability to see the machine as more than when you were first led up to it, that you can make it more.

- Premature optimization is the root of all evil.
- When I speak about computer programming as an art, I am thinking primarily of it as an art form, in an aesthetic sense. The chief goal of my work as an educator and author is to help people learn how to write beautiful programs ... My feeling is that when we prepare a program, the experience can be just like composing poetry or music ... Some programs are elegant, some are exquisite, some are sparkling. My claim is that it is possible to write grand programs, noble programs, truly magnificent ones! ... computer programming is an art, because it applies accumulated knowledge to the world, because it requires skill and ingenuity, and especially because it produces objects of beauty. Programmers who subconsciously view themselves as artists will enjoy what they do and will do it better.

Now, it's my belief that Python is a lot easier than to teach to students programming and teach them C or C++ or Java at the same time because all the details of the languages are so much harder. Other scripting languages really don't work very well there either.
