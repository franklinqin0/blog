GAs are not suited for all problems, especially problems which are simple and for which derivative information is available.
Fitness value is calculated repeatedly which might be computationally expensive for some problems.
Being stochastic, there are no guarantees on the optimality or the quality of the solution.
If not implemented properly, the GA may not converge to the optimal solution.
Stochastic algorithms in general can have difficulty obeying equality constraints.
the GA is sensitive to the initial population used. Wide diversity of feasible solutions is what you want.

Me: GA depends heavily on the initial population and may not find a feasible solution if not operated properly. Being stochastic, there are no guarantees on the optimality or the quality of the solution. It is a consensus by academia that GA, though useful in many contexts, is at best the 2nd best way to solve any problem.
