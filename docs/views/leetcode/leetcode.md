I keep notes for [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com) problems I solved.

<!-- more -->

## Why I Am Doing This

While most people do Leetcode to find a (better) job, I do it to review my algorithm knowledge, improve coding skills, not feel bored, and may find an SDE job.

Other than these reasons, I also learned `C++` along the way because there are many solutions on Leetcode discussions written in the language.

## Problems I solved

- [Longest Common Prefix](longest_common_prefix)
- [Longest Palindrome Substring](longest_palindrome_substring)
- [Shortest Palindrome](shortest_palindrome)
- [Two Sum](two_sum)
- [Longest Common Subsequence](longest-common-subsequence)

## Language I used

I previously used `Java` extensively, but will use `Python3` from now on for the speed, simplicity and elegance.

## Edge Cases

Watch out for the following edge cases:

- empty string
- empty array
