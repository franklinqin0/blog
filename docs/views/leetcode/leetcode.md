I keep notes for [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com) problems I solved.

## Why I Am Doing This

While most people do Leetcode to find a (better) job, I do it to review my algorithm knowledge, improve coding skills, not feel bored, and may find an SDE job.

Other than these reasons, I also learned `C++` along the way because there are many solutions on Leetcode discussions written in the language.

## Problems I solved (??? should organize once migrated)

- [Longest Common Prefix](longest_common_prefix)
- [Longest Palindrome Substring](longest_palindrome_substring)
- [Shortest Palindrome](shortest_palindrome)
- [Two Sum](two_sum)
- [Longest Common Subsequence](longest-common-subsequence)

## Checklist I followed

This is the checklist I followed for each blog:

- state the problem
- follow up or note if any
- `<!-- more -->` tag for better preview
- problem (and article) links
- code snippet if any
- solution
  - title to summarize
  - elaboration of algo
  - time&space complexity
  - code
  - further notes

## Languages I used

### Java

I previously used `Java` extensively, because one of my best friends said Java gives you a better time to explain the underlying data structure.

### C++

I was actually learning the language and am now reading many solutions in this language. However, C++ is known for a steep learning curve, and I don't think it's a good idea to write my solution while checking how to do a thing in it.

### Python 3

My officially first programming language is Python 2, from which I learned if, for, while, simple but useful data structures like list and map, and finally even a little OOP before learning Java. Several years later, Python is extinct and Python 3 inherits the speed, simplicity and elegance.

Thus, now I am using Python 3.

## Edge Cases - A Note for Myself

ALWAYS watch out for the edge cases with typical ones including but not limited to:

- empty string
- empty array
