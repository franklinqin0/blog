Hi, I'm Franklin Qin.

<!-- more -->

I was born and grew up in mainland China till going for college in U.S. I studied Operations Research and Computer Science at Cornell University from August 2014 to May 2018.

I was a technology analyst working at GS in Hong Kong from July 2018 to August 2019.

I was a voluntary teacher in CJ, Guizhou, China from September to December 2019.

I will keep writing blogs because of my adamant love for [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax), b/c it's simple and down-to-earth, just like me.
