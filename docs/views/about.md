Hi, I'm Franklin Qin.

<!-- more -->

I was born and grew up in mainland China till going for college in U.S. I studied Operations Research and Computer Science at Cornell University from August 2014 to May 2018.

I was a technology analyst working at GS in Hong Kong from July 2018 to August 2019.

Now I am a voluntary teacher in Guizhou, China.

This is an anecdote about starting this site: [Youth](youth)

I don't like to broadcast myself across the world, while I welcome those who come across my site and interested in my life to know more about me and my thoughts.

I will keep writing blogs because of my adamant love for [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax). It's simple and down-to-earth, just like me. And I'M LOVIN IT~~~
