Hi, I'm Franklin Qin.

<!-- more -->

I was born in Jingzhou, Hubei and grew up in Wuhan and Guangzhou, China.

I majored in Operations Research and minored in Computer Science at Cornell University from August 2014 to May 2018.

I was a technology analyst working at GS in Hong Kong from July 2018 to August 2019.

I was a voluntary teacher in CJ, Guizhou, China from September to December 2019.

Now I am a full stack developer at a tech startup in Guangzhou, China.

I will always keep writing blogs in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax), b/c it's simple and down-to-earth, just like me.
