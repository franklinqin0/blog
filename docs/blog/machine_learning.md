## Classification

Classification is the task of choosing the correct class label for a given input (= instance) based on its features, e.g.:

- Email spam classification
- Categorizing news articles by topic

### Classification variants

- binary (2 classes) vs. multi-class classification (> 2 classes)
  - multi-class problem can be decomposed using binary classifiers
- single-label vs. multi-label classification
  - each instance may be assigned one vs. multiple class labels
- sequence classification
  - a sequence of instances are jointly classified
