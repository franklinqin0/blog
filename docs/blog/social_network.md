## Introduction

Homo Sapiens need social interactions. People used to send messages by homing pigeons or telegraph, but now use social networks to text, call by video or audio, share family photos, read latest news, etc. As social media triggered unprecedented ease of access of information, it has also led to detrimental effect on both mental health and social well-being. However, if a concerted effort is made to build healthy social networks, they could constructively influence the human society.

## Social Networks Destruct Mental Health

::: theorem
There are only two industries that call their customers "users": illegal drugs and software.

While we increasingly rely on social networks to interact with each other, we have evolved to be attentive, if not anxious, to whether our friends think well of us or not. We conflate fake and brittle popularity with truth and value; we tend to resort to digital pacifiers when become lonely and afraid; essentially, we abandon face-to-face communications, physical activities, exposure to nature, and sleep[^1].

According to Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen, "Facebook has realized that if they change the algorithm to be safer, people will spend less time on the site, they'll click on less ads, they'll make less money."[^2] Thus, when Facebook discovered that as teenage girls consume eating disorder content and get more and more depressed, it took no action. Such irresponsible behaviour prompts them to use the app more, hence the vicious cycle.

Despite their initial aim to help connect the world, social networks such as Facebook and Twitter turn to digital Frankensteins that terraform the world and destruct mental health[^1].

## Unobjective Algorithm Threatens Social Welfare

::: theorem
Accidents, crimes, natural and man-made disasters, threats of conflict, gloomy editorials - these still seemed to be the main concern of the millions of words being sprayed into the ether.

The backend unobjective algorithm was written not for the users, but to serve the writer. Sadly and inevitably, it not only fuels users' addiction and distraction, but also threatens social welfare.

Based on the users' age, gender, location, past click-behaviours, search history, etc., the automated micro-targeting algorithm could construct a profile around each user and provide personalized content enticing hate and violence. As algorithm understands users better, users are trapped in a filte bubble, assuming that everyone thinks alike and forget other perspectives. Also, on social media users are easily susceptible to misinformation, which travels six times faster on Twitter than true news[^3].

As algorithm imperceptibly polarized and outraged human society, it has already induced many distressing social consequences: the Rohingya genocide in Myanmar[^4], Cambridge Analytica data scandal[^5], Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election[^6], Pizzagate fake news scandal[^7], arson attacks to 5G towers[^8], etc.

Further, as a centralized data source, social networks own totalitarian control over the spread of information. Two weeks before the 2020 U.S. election, Twitter censored the New York Post article containing screenshots of emails by Hunter Biden, Joe Biden's son[^9]. While it seems sensible for Twitter to flag Donald Trump's tweets about the 2020 U.S. election as "inaccurate", permanently suspending his account without any checks and balances is perplexing[^10]. It is problematic that a private company, rather than the government, is able to limit freedom of speech in our society.

For social networks tech giants, profit-making is more vital than protecting privacy data and societal safety. However, government policies fail to contain social media's threat to social well-being.

As social networks prioritize profit growth over privacy data and societal safety, government policies should be implemented to contain their serious threat to social well-being.

## Don't be Evil

::: theorem
The real problem of humanity is the following: we have paleolithic emotions, medieval institutions and god-like technology.

Edward O. Wilson, father of sociobiology

The potentially healthy impact of social networks on human society requires a collective effort.

While adults can always regain control by uninstalling toxic social apps such as Facebook, Instagram and Twitter[^11], teenagers' prefrontal cortex just start to develop, have little self-control and require parental guidance. Therefore, parents should regulate kids' on-screen time and be good role models in use of social networks[^12].

In addition, social networks must abandon current business model which exploit users, but should instead respect users as friends[^13]. The software design goal should be switched from "time spent" to "time well spent" and "net positive contribution" to human society[^14]. The middle ground between profit and user experience does exist and worth exploring.

Evidently, capital would always pursue profits, but laws should ensure social well-being. Though General Data Protection Regulation has protected data privacy, fake news, polarization, extremism, toxic tribalism are still rampant[^15]. Governments should form a cross country coalition to regain the rights to censor misinformation, penalize polarisation and scrutinize algorithms on multiple metrics, namely, mental health, social isolation, fake news, and polarization[^16]. A directorate should be initiated by the government to guarantee that social media would render the deletion of personal data, chat history, more accessible on user interface. Age limit on social networks should be increased from 13 to 16[^17], and screen time for the underage should be strictly restricted to about 5 hours each week to fight against addiction and depression.

Still, social networks can be benevolent if the developers retain good intentions. Artificial Intelligence (AI) beings created by Xiaoice Island are beyond imagination: not only can they compose poems, sing songs, draw paintings and edit videos, they can also chat, create group chat, like and comment on moments posted by the human[^18]. They would not be annoyed to be awakened at 2 a.m., but offer emotional support and selfless friendship. Although Xiaoice has advanced natural language processing technologies, it refused to license it and earn profits. If more social networks can align business interests and social responsibility like Xiaoice, they could possibly better our society.

Technology could easily be evil, but if we work together and insist on healthy social networks, they might be benevolent to human society.
