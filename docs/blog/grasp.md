## Basic Concepts

1. *grasp pose*: position and orientation of a grasp.
2. *4-DoF grasp*: hand poses are generated and defined by a 3D position and hand orientation about an approach vector (commonly aligned with the direction of gravity), usually referred to as "top-down grasping".
3. *6-DoF grasp*: hand poses are generated and defined by a 3D position and orientation, thus 6 DoFs in total. Major difference to 4-Dof grasp: nonfixed approach vector, extra flexibility but increased complexity.
4. *affordance*: different tasks which can be achieved with an object.

affordance learning is to locate the “action possibilities” regions of an object

pick up objects in random order?

to add: discriminative vs. generative
