### Interpretation

No precomputation on program text necessary  
$\rightarrow$ no/small startup-overhead

More context information allows for specific aggressive optimization

### Compilation

Program components are analyzed once, during preprocessing, instead of multiple times during execution  
$\rightarrow$ smaller runtime-overhead

Runtime complexity of optimizations less important than in interpreter

### NP

Class of computational decision problems for which any given yes-solution can be verified as a solution in polynomial time by a deterministic Turing machine (or solvable by a non-deterministic Turing machine in polynomial time).

### NP-hard

Class of problems which are at least as hard as the hardest problems in NP. Problems that are NP-hard do not have to be elements of NP; indeed, they may not even be decidable.

### NP-complete

Class of decision problems which contains the hardest problems in NP. Each NP-complete problem has to be in NP.
