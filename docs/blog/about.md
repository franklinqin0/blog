Hi, I'm Franklin Qin.

<!-- more -->

I was born in Jingzhou, Hubei and grew up in Wuhan and Guangzhou, China.

I finished my bachelor at Cornell (OR major, CS minor) and then worked as a technology analyst in HK for a year.

Later on I went for voluntary teaching and worked at a small tech start-up, before I applied for German universities.

I love playing table tennis, tennis, badminton, and Texas Holdem. In my free time I love playing violin, listening to classical music (Bach and Beethoven are my all-time favorites!), watching films, and of course coding. My German level is now B2.1 and I hope to reach C1 within this year. You could talk to me in German/English/Mandarin/Cantonese!

I am now a Informatik(CS) master student at TUM.
