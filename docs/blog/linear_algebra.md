A matrix is **unitary** if the _inverse_ of the matrix is equal to the _conjugate transpose_ of the matrix.

An algorithm is a sequence of steps, which solves a problem when carried out in order.

A † = (A ∗ ) T
the conjugate transpose of A

A matrix A is called Hermitian if A † = A.

unitary: A † A = I.

self-inverse

simp: step-by-step
auto: just prove it
