A matrix is **unitary** if the _inverse_ of the matrix is equal to the _conjugate transpose_ of the matrix.

An algorithm is a sequence of steps, which solves a problem when carried out in order.

A † = (A ∗ ) T
the conjugate transpose of A

A matrix A is called Hermitian if A † = A.

unitary: A † A = I.

self-inverse

auto: just prove it

Every symmetric matrix is a linear combination of orthogonal projection matrices.

For a symmetric matrix, signs of pivots are the same as signs of eigenvalues.

Positive definite matrix is symmetric. All eigenvalues are positive. All pivots are positive. All subdeterminants are positive.

product of pivots = products of eigenvalues?
