- If I weren't so pretty/handsome/smart, would you still love me?
- But you are, and for the opposite I cannot imagine.

- What if we don't have much to talk about one day? Would we still love each other? Would it be boring to stay together?
- Being together doesn't mean we have to talk. We could each do stuff we like by ourselves, and still love each other. Love doesn't mean we have to talk about interesting things all day long.
