To this day, I still remembered a conversation with a gloved worker beside Central Park in my freshman year. I didnâ€™t know where to go and my network data ran out. I asked him the direction, he then kindly walked with me and talked about his experience along the way. He also went to Cornell, and told funny stories of Okenshield unable to retrieve the dishes at the end of term because students were allowed to take them away but not forced to return. However, he dropped out for some reason I cannot recall. I felt sad for him but did not know how to express my regret. He pointed to me a tall skinny colorful office building still in construction and was awed by its price. Before long, we bid each other farewell and parted at an intersection.
