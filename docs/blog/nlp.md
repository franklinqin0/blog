| Token      | A sequence of characters that is treated as a single group (i.e., words and punctuation).                                                                                                                                    |
| Type       | A “type” is the form or spelling of the token (including words and punctuation) independently of its specific occurrences in a text. Mind that “type” is highly ambiguous and thus has different meanings in other contexts! |
| Vocabulary | The vocabulary of a text is the _set_ of tokens it uses.                                                                                                                                                                     |
