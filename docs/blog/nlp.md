## Definition

- **Token:** A sequence of characters that is treated as a single group (i.e., words and punctuation)
- **Type:** A “type” is the form or spelling of the token (including words and punctuation) independently of its specific occurrences in a text. Mind that “type” is highly ambiguous and thus has different meanings in other contexts!
- **Vocabulary:** The vocabulary of a text is the _set_ of tokens it uses
- **corpora:** large bodies of linguistic data

## Information Retrieval

Information retrieval (IR) is **finding** material (usually **documents**) of an **unstructured** nature (usually text) that satisfies an **information need** from within **large collections** (usually stored on computers).

- **Information Need:** State (of a person) of requiring information for solving an actual problem (e.g.: get rid of mice without hurting them). Also called intent
- **Query:** Textual representation of the information need, e.g. as entered into a search engine
- **Relevance:** Property of a document with respect to a particular information need. The task of IR is to retrieve relevant documents
- **Relevance Feedback:** Information about the actual relevance of retrieved documents given by the user of an IR system to the system
- **IR Evaluation:** Measuring the quality of an IR system’s performance
