## Inductive Bias vs. Bias-Variance Tradeoff

Inductive Bias: The assumptions a model makes to generalize from training data to unseen data.

Bias-Variance Tradeoff: The balance between bias (error due to oversimplified models) and variance (error due to overly complex models).

Relation: Inductive bias influences the bias-variance tradeoff by determining the modelâ€™s complexity and assumptions. Choosing the right inductive bias helps in finding the optimal point in the bias-variance tradeoff for good generalization.
