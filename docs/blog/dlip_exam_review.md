## Problem 2, 2

I feel that deducting all 2 points due to the lack of $n^2$ is a bit unfair. Although the question asks "the computational cost of obtaining the image", I was misled by the expression "the intensity value **at each coordinate**" (a better expression could be: "the intensity values at **all** coordinates"). Thus, I understood wrong what the question intends to ask and crossed out the $n^2$'s in the middle steps. To sum up, I feel that I actually understand how to arrive at the final solution, and hope that partial points could be given for my understanding.

## Problem 3(a)

It's pretty fair to deduct points because I did not notice that $U$ has its columns orthogonal, but not necessarily the rows. However, I think the equal sign is still correct? Because either way, $\left\|\mathbf{U}^T \mathbf{e}\right\|_2^2 = \left\|\mathbf{e}\right\|_2^2$?

## Problem 4(c)

In my answer, I have arrived at the first step, I feel it's pretty obvious to use the linearity of expectation to reach the second step, the final solution? I feel giving only half of the three total credits for all the derivations but just leaving out the last obvious step is a bit too strict?
