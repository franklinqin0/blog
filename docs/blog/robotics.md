Roboticist required knowledge:

- Optimization (e.g., least squares, quadratic programs with constraints, nonlinear optimization problems, gradient descent)
- Probability theory (e.g., probability density functions, Bayesâ€™ rule, maximum likelihood, Gaussian distributions)
- Introductory control theory (e.g., PID controller, Bode plot, transfer function, stability)
- State-space control methods (e.g., state-space representation, pole placement through eigenvalue analysis, LQR)
- Optimal control (e.g., Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, Pontryagin minimum principle, numerical algorithms to solve optimal control problems)
- Robotics (e.g., programming a robot to do a task, robot components such as perception, planning, estimation, control)
- State estimation (e.g., recursive least squares, Kalman filter, EKF, UKF)
- Perception / computer vision (e.g., feature descriptors, segmentation, classification)
- Introductory machine learning course (e.g., regression, classification, SVMs, neural networks, expectation maximization)
- Deep neural networks (e.g., back propagation, automatic differentiation, CNNs)
- Reinforcement learning
- Matlab
- C++ programming
- Python programming
- Machine learning tools such as TensorFlow or PyTorch
- Simulation tools such as OpenAI Gym or MuJoCo
- Linux
- Using GPUs
