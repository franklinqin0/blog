这些天一直在老家

早上收到这封由Dean of Engineering发给alumni的邮件，感慨万分。

::: tip Dean of Engineering
Please reach out to us if there is something you need. In the meantime, please take care of yourselves and each other. Practice social distancing to the extent you are able, but don’t forget to practice emotional closeness as well. Engineering is all about teamwork and this challenge is no different. We can get through this together.

We hope to see you on campus once we move past this trying time.
