This page documents good quotes I came across:

爱因斯坦：我必须尽一切努力，以使自己配得上生命的所得

泰戈尔(Tagore), 飞鸟集(Stray Birds)：

- What you are you do not see, what you see is your shadow
- The bird wishes it were a cloud. The cloud wishes it were a bird
- The waterfall sings, "I find my song, when I find my freedom"
- You smiled and talked to me of nothing and I felt that for this I had been waiting long
- Life is given to us, we earn it by giving it
- Chastity is a wealth that comes from abundance of love
- Let life be beautiful like summer flowers and death like autumn leaves (生如夏花之绚烂，死如秋叶之静美)
- The grass seeks her crowd in the earth. The tree seeks his solitude of the sky
