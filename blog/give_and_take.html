It summarizes the content of the book <em>Give and Take: Why Helping Others Drives Our Success</em> by Adam Grant. It is one of the few humanities books I read at Cornell I deemed as interesting and worth reading.</p> <p>The book <em>Give and Take</em> by Adam Grant illustrates the principles of givers, takers, and matchers, and why and how givers always end up better than others. Apparently, givers are &quot;other-focused, paying more attention to what other people need from them&quot;, takers &quot;tend to be self-focused, evaluating what other people can offer them&quot;, and matchers fall in the middle of the reciprocity spectrum: they believe in tit for tat and exchange favors evenly.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> It is not how much they donate to charity that distinguishes givers and takers, but by their attitudes and actions towards other people: takers help others strategically when the benefits to them outweigh the personal costs, whereas givers help whenever the benefits to others exceed the personal cost.</p> <p>Intuitively, givers are too willing to sacrifice their own interests for the benefit of others, so they land at the bottom of the success ladder. But it is surprising that it is the givers who are at the top as well, leaving the takers and matchers in the middle.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup> So, what makes the givers become champs or chumps?</p> <h2 id="selfless-or-otherish-givers"><a href="#selfless-or-otherish-givers" class="header-anchor">#</a> Selfless or otherish givers?</h2> <p>There seem to be two kinds of givers: selfless givers with &quot;high other-interest and low self-interest&quot;, and otherish givers who care about benefiting others, but also &quot;advance their own interests&quot;.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup> While takers rarely help others and matchers expect help in return from each person they help, givers often help others at the expense of their own well-being.</p> <p>With an idealistic mindset to &quot;set out to make a difference, improving education and opportunities for kids in low-income communities&quot;,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">[4]</a></sup> the twenty-four-year-old Teach for America (TFA) neophyte Conrey Callahan arrived at school early, stayed up late, and worked weekends. She spent her day breaking up fights, battling crime, and tracking down the truant students who only showed up for two days of class in an entire year. Soon, she was burned out and depressed. Instead of reducing her giving, she gave <em>more</em>. She created a Philadelphia chapter of Minds Matter and was spending more than 10 extra hours per week giving, but her burnout faded, and became more energetic than ever.</p> <p>These all happened due to her extra day at Minds Matter. First, the daily interaction with the students may take years to impact. Thus, teachers have no affirmation of the benefits of their giving. Additionally, teachers have to fight many distractions and disadvantages to stimulate the attention, or even attendance of students. It was the feeling that she was not making a difference rather than giving too much that made Conrey emotionally exhausted. By mentoring high-achieving students from low-income families at Minds Matter, she received positive feedback more rapidly, and in her philanthropic job found enjoyment and purpose rather than duty and obligation. The happiness gained from giving with affirmation had lasting motivation to sustain her efforts as a teacher.</p> <p>The second reason has to do with where and to whom she gave. &quot;Giving more can be exhausting if it is in the same domain <span class="vuepress-eq"><span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo>⋯</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\cdots</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.31em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="minner">⋯</span></span></span></span></span> At Minds Matter, she had a new setting and a new group of people to help. Instead of teaching [students] Spanish, she was getting them ready for college&quot;.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">[5]</a></sup> She was able to recharge her energy by giving to a novel domain.</p> <p>Moreover, Conrey shifted from a &quot;sprinkler&quot; to a &quot;chunker&quot;. A chunker packs all acts of giving into a single day each week, while a sprinkler would give a little bit each day. &quot;At Minds Matter, Conrey packed her volunteering into one day a week, giving all five weekly hours of mentoring high school students on Saturdays&quot;.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">[6]</a></sup> By chunking her giving into weekly blocks, she could &quot;experience her impact more vividly, leading her efforts to feel like 'more than a drop in the bucket'&quot;.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7">[7]</a></sup> Conrey focused on mentoring during Saturdays and so avoided the distraction and exhaustion to mentor students after school as a selfless giver. Planned giving revitalized rather than drained her.</p> <p>Most importantly, unlike a selfless giver, Conrey. as an otherish giver, was not shy to ask for help. When she felt miserable and did not enjoying teaching, she turned to a teacher named Sarah for help. Inspired by Sarah's novel teaching method, Conrey &quot;had fun with the kids, and [invested more] in the curriculum [she] was teaching&quot;.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8">[8]</a></sup> While the selfless givers feel uncomfortable receiving support, research showed that the lack of social support is linked to burnout.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9">[9]</a></sup> On the contrary, at the brink of burnout, otherish givers come together in groups to provide and receive joint protection. Their giving would strengthen their relationships and build support. Thus, otherish givers like Conrey build up a support network that they can ask for help when needed. Social support as well as chunking giving make otherish givers more resilient to burnout than selfless givers.</p> <p>Unlike selfless givers who end up being miserable, otherish givers receive pleasure and purpose signals, which motivate them to work harder and smarter to build up their fortune and contribute more to others' benefits through sustained giving.</p> <p>Naturally we would ask: with less giving and less risk of burnout, why do the takers and matchers not end up higher on the success ladder?</p> <h2 id="zero-sum-loss-or-win-win-gain"><a href="#zero-sum-loss-or-win-win-gain" class="header-anchor">#</a> Zero-sum loss or win-win gain?</h2> <p>As the venture capitalist Randy Komisar remarks, &quot;It's easier to win if everybody wants you to win. If you don't make enemies out there, it's easier to succeed.&quot; This definitely makes sense in some arenas, but in politics, the costs of giving apparently outweigh the benefits. In political situations, &quot;Takers should have an edge in lobbying and outmaneuvering their opponents in competitive elections, and matchers may be well suited to the constant trading of favors that politics demands&quot;, but the giver Abraham Lincoln won by giving.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn10" id="fnref10">[10]</a></sup></p> <p>At age 45, after serving in state legislature for eight years, Lincoln made a bid for the Senate. He originally faced two opponents: James Shields and Lyman Trumbull. After Shields dropped out, a new candidate, the state's current governor, Joel Matteson quickly took the lead. Matteson had 44 percent, Lincoln was down to 38 percent, and Trumbull was at just 9 percent but with a royal voter base. Instead of trusting Matteson, whom Lincoln believed was engaging in questionable practices and one year later indicted for fraud, Lincoln believed in Trumbull and shared common views on issues vital to the future of his state. Thus, Lincoln asked his supporters to vote for Trumbull, who eventually won the race. It was at the expense of Lincoln to propel Trumbull to victory.</p> <p>In the Oval Office, Lincoln continued to put the good of the nation above his own ego.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn11" id="fnref11">[11]</a></sup> When he won the presidency in 1860, he invited the three candidates whom he defeated for the Republican nomination to become his cabinet members. Every member of the administration was better known, better educated, and more experienced in public life than Lincoln. Although some of these rivals despised Lincoln, and others viewed him as incompetent, he managed to win them all over. In Lincoln's position, a taker might have preferred to protect his ego and power by inviting &quot;yes man&quot; to join him; a matcher might have offered appointments to allies who had supported him; yet Lincoln invited his bitter competitors instead. As a giver, Lincoln won over people not by power and strength, but with kindness, sensitivity, compassion, honesty, and empathy, all of which are invaluable political resources. Lincoln understood that as he gave more, people would reciprocate and help him achieve his ambition through concerted effort. As givers give more, they build a powerful social network when they resort for help when needed.</p> <p>Lincoln was not the only one to see giving as expanding the pie rather than a zero-sum game. As a successful Silicon Valley entrepreneur and a generous giver, Adam Rifkin adopts to the rule called &quot;the five-minute favor&quot;: &quot;[one] should be willing to do something that [costs] five minutes or less for anybody&quot;.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn12" id="fnref12">[12]</a></sup> Rifkin believed that through mutual help we could create value for everyone and introduce high productivity for all involved.</p> <p>Rifkin's revelation originated from the following story. In 1995, Rifkin built a fan website for the band Green Day and received an email from a serious punk rock fan named Graham Spencer.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn13" id="fnref13">[13]</a></sup> Spencer suggested that people should find more than Green Day when they searched for punk rock on the Internet. Rifkin hence set up a separate page on the Green Day fan site with links to the punk rock bands that Spencer suggested. In 1998, Spencer sold Excite for $6.7 billion, the popular Internet startup where he was the co-founder, largest shareholder and chief technology officer. Shortly after the sale, Spencer received an email out of blue from Adam Rifkin, who was asking for advice on a startup. Though they had never met, Spencer volunteered to sit down with Rifkin, and connected Rifkin with a venture capitalist in their second meeting. Rifkin founded his startup Renkoo in 2000, gained huge success, but decided to shut it down in 2009, so that he could focus on contributing to others in a network called 106 Miles.</p> <p>When givers give, they &quot;do not expect anything specific back from you, in the confident expectation that someone else will do something for them down the road&quot;.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn14" id="fnref14">[14]</a></sup> When givers like Rifkin build networks, they expand the pie so that everyone can get a larger slice. He transforms giving from a zero-sum loss to a win-win gain.</p> <p>The case is different with matchers and takers. Matchers limit themselves to deals in which their immediate benefit is at least as great as the benefits for others.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn15" id="fnref15">[15]</a></sup> As matchers insist on quid pro quo every time they help others, matchers have a much narrower network. In contrast, takers &quot;[burn] bridges by constantly asking for favors but rarely reciprocating. Their colleagues [see] them as selfish and punished them with a lack of respect&quot;.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn16" id="fnref16">[16]</a></sup> Takers are obsessed with making a good impression upward, but worried less about the image seen by those below them. They tend to &quot;kiss up&quot;: charm and flatter their influential superiors, but &quot;kick down&quot;: dominate and control their subordinates.</p> <p>In the end, the givers earn more respect from their colleagues and succeed easier with help from others, because as mentioned at the beginning of this section: it is easier to win if everybody wants you to win.</p> <h2 id="rippled-success"><a href="#rippled-success" class="header-anchor">#</a> Rippled success</h2> <p>While a genius taker often &quot;has the confidence to generate original ideas that buck traditions and fight uphill battles to champion these ideas&quot;, <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn17" id="fnref17">[17]</a></sup> the independence comes at a price. A giver, however, would prompt his team members to achieve rippled successes.</p> <p>Frank Lloyd Wright was recognized as the greatest American architect of all time by the American Institute of Architects. Although he was prolific throughout the first quarter of the twentieth century, he took a nine-year nosedive beginning in 1924.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn18" id="fnref18">[18]</a></sup> He benefited from the assistance of craftspeople and sculptors when he lived in Chicago and Oak Park, Illinois. But as a taker who believed in independent excellence, Wright moved to Taliesin, an estate in a remote Wisconsin valley. At Taliesin, Wright continued his architectural design, but lacked access to talented apprentices, who would help him complete his building designs. It was not until 1932 that he started a fellowship for apprentices to help him with his work. Since then, his productivity soared, and he was soon working on the Fallingwater house, which would be seen by many as the greatest work of architecture in modern history. Wright's drought &quot;lasted until he gave up on independence and began to work interdependently again with talented collaborators&quot;<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn19" id="fnref19">[19]</a></sup>.</p> <p>Americans see independence as a symbol of strength, viewing interdependence as a sign of weakness. This is especially true of takers like Wright, who tend to see themselves as superior to and separate from others. However, givers tend to &quot;see interdependence as a source of strength, a way to harness the skills of multiple people for a greater good&quot;. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn20" id="fnref20">[20]</a></sup> George Meyer is such a giver.</p> <p>In <em>The Simpsons</em>, &quot;the most popular task for writers was typically to write the first draft of an episode, as it allowed them to put their creative stamp on it&quot;.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn21" id="fnref21">[21]</a></sup> Meyer would generate many ideas for episodes, but he rarely wrote the first draft. Instead, feeling that his skills were needed more in rewriting, he took responsibility for the dirty work of spending months helping to rewrite, revise, and improve others' jokes in each episode. According to Time Long, a writer for <em>The Simpsons</em>, &quot;often people tend to come up with ideas and jealously guard them, but [Meyer] would create ideas, give them to someone else and never take credit&quot;.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn22" id="fnref22">[22]</a></sup> By avoiding the responsibility bias, a typical taker's vulnerability: exaggerating one's own contributions relative to others' inputs, givers like Meyer collaborate by taking on the tasks that are in the group's best interest, not necessarily their own personal interests.</p> <p>&quot;When Meyer gave away the credits he deserved, takers no longer felt that they needed to compete with him, matchers felt that they owed him, and givers saw him as one of them&quot;.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn23" id="fnref23">[23]</a></sup> Meyer's work attitudes influenced his colleagues and triggered them to try harder and achieve high collective standards. As a result of the successful collaboration with his fellow writers, <em>The Simpsons</em> has won twenty-seven prime-time Emmy Awards, six of which went to Meyer. Unlike Wright, who was a taker and a lone genius, Meyer was both a genius and a genius maker: he used his &quot;intelligence to amplify the smarts and capabilities of other people&quot;,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn24" id="fnref24">[24]</a></sup> and made his success &quot;rippled, cascaded, and spread to the people around him&quot;.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn25" id="fnref25">[25]</a></sup></p> <h2 id="conclusion"><a href="#conclusion" class="header-anchor">#</a> Conclusion</h2> <p>While takers are like black holes to suck up energy from people surrounding them, givers inject light around the organization; they expand the pie to share with all, turn a zero-sum loss to a win-win gain, and cascade their own success to others. Through giving, they learn from each other and help each other succeed. However, they are cautious that their giving does not deplete and burn out their own energy. They resort to powerful and supportive social networks to revitalize their passion and contribute in long-term effort. Essentially, they understand the two great forces of human nature: self-interest and caring for others. With both in mind and actions, they are continually making the world a better place.</p> <h2 id="bibliography"><a href="#bibliography" class="header-anchor">#</a> Bibliography</h2> <p>Grant, Adam. 2013.
